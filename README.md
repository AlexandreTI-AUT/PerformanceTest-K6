## Introduction ##

k6 can run many types of tests, each of which serves a different testing goal.

Each test type teaches you something different about your system.

- **Smoke tests** verify that your system can handle minimal load, without any problems.
- **Load tests** assess system performance in terms of concurrent users or requests per second.
- **Stress and Spike tests** assess the limits and stability of your system under extreme conditions.
- **Soak tests** assess the reliability and performance of your system over an extended period of time.
